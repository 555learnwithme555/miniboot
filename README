Computing the hexadecimal address for bootloader start section:
- make clean; make main.hex; ### take output, let's say it's 2123 (or similar)
- for the size of your device (8kb = 1024 * 8 = 8192) minus above value 2123... = 6069
- Which yelds 6069 / 64 (mega328p page size in bytes) = 94.828125 pages of flash memory
- round it down to 94 - our new bootloader address is 94 * 64 = 6016, in hex = 1780h
- put the value in the BOOTLOADER_START_ADDRESS macro in the Makefile of manually edit bootloader.h
